This Repository is from other repository (https://github.com/TwoHandSword/STM32_BoardSW_WithMQTT) which was already made in this project

the existing repository manage STM32CubeExpansion_Cloud_AWS_V2.0.0\Projects\B-L4S5I-IOT01A\Applications\Cloud\aws_demos folder

but when cubeIde build project ,cubeIde have to include other sw in other folders in STM32CubeExpansion_Cloud_AWS_V2.0.0 folder

So, this new repository will cover STM32CubeExpansion_Cloud_AWS_V2.0.0 folder. which include aws_demos folder

At the begging of this repository,
aws_demos folder is same as commit (1)myTask.c , myTask.h 2개의 파일을 새로 추가) in (https://github.com/TwoHandSword/STM32_BoardSW_WithMQTT)
